They had discovered San Salvador (the Bahamas), which is part of the New World. This discovery allowed for Spain, and the other European countries shortly thereafter, to exploit indigenous peoples for labor. In addition, American goods could be exported to Europe in the Columbian Exchange. Columbus's discovery of the New World marked a turning point in European history as the wealth of countries quickly swelled from the riches to be found in the Americas.`
